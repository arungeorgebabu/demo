*STRING METHODS
1. len()   
it is for finding the length of a string
eg. name="arun"
length=len(name)
printh(length)
2. str()
it is used for change an integer or float to string.

3.  .lower()
it is used to allow the characters in a string in lower case
eg. str1="GEORGE"
print(str1 .lower())
4.   .upper()
it allows the characters in a string in upper case.


eg str2="arun"
print(str2 .upper())

*Format operator
 it si using for replacing strings by using % symbol
eg. name=input("what is your name")
occupation=input("what is your occupation")
print("your name is %s and your occupation is %s" % (name,occupation))

*Flow control and comparators
<,<=,>,>=,==,!=
eg; print(5<6)
print(12==2)
check these examples in the pycham

*If,Else and Elif

eg  if 10==9:
    print("both are same")
else:
    print("both are different ")

the elif statement execute another statement rather than the first 
if statement
between if and else statement we can use any number of elif statement

*Functions
the function is using for code reusability. once a function is defined,
it can be use over and over again.
You can invoke the same function many times in your program,which
saves your work.	
$ function with zero parameters
$function with 1 or more than 1 parameters
 function with arguments (parameters) and with return value.
 function with arguments (parameters) and without return value.
 function without arguments (parameters) and without return value.
 function without arguments (parameters) and with return value.

function defining ; use keyword def
eg; def eg():
here 'eg' is the function name
after unction defining we must call that function with the same function name
eg; eg()
